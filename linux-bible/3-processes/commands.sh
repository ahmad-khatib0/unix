# Listing processes

# TTY represent which terminal is running this proceses
# STAT: with R indicating a currently running process and S representing a sleeping process
# VSZ (virtual set size) shows the size of the image process (in kilobytes)
# RSS (resident set size) shows the size of the program in memory.
# The VSZ and RSS sizes may be different because VSZ is the amount of memory allocated for the 
# process, whereas RSS is the amount that is actually being used. RSS memory represents physical 
# memory that cannot be swapped.
# START shows the time the process began running
# TIME shows the cumulative system time used. (0:00 means havenâ€™t even used a whole second of CPU time.)
