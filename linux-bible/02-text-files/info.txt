If you use ssh -X to connect to the remote system, a GUI-based editor pops up on your local screen. 
  When no GUI is available, you need a text editor that runs in the shell, such as vi, jed, or joe.

/The.*foot: Searches forward for a line that has the word The in it and also, 
  after that at some point, the word foot.
  
?[pP]rint: Searches backward for either print or Print. Remember that case matters in Linux, 
  so make use of brackets to search for words that could have different capitalization.

:g/Local/s//Remote/gp: Substitutes every occurrence of the word Local with the word Remote in the 
  entire file and then prints each line so that you can see the changes (piping it through less 
  if output fills more than one page).

On most Linux systems (Fedora and RHEL included), the updatedb command runs once per
  day to gather the names of files throughout your Linux system into a database. By running
  the locate command, you can search that database to find the location of files stored in it.

■■ Not every file in your filesystem is stored in the database. The contents of the /etc/updatedb.conf
  file limit which filenames are collected by pruning out select mount types, filesystem types, 
  file types, and mount points. For example, filenames are not gathered from remotely mounted 
  filesystems (cifs, nfs, and so on) or locally mounted CDs or DVDs (iso9660). Paths containing 
  temporary files (/tmp) and spool files (/var/spool/cups) are also pruned. You can add items to
  prune (or remove some items that you don’t want pruned) the locate database to your needs. 
  In RHEL 8, the updatedb.conf file contains the following:
  
  PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS = "yes"
  PRUNEFS = "9p afs anon_inodefs auto autofs bdev binfmt_misc cgroup cifs coda configfs cpuset 
  debugfs devpts ecryptfs exofs fuse fuse .sshfs fusectl gfs gfs2 gpfs hugetlbfs inotifyfs 
  iso9660 jffs2 lustre mqueue ncpfs nfs nfs4 nfsd pipefs proc ramfs rootfs rpc_pipefs securityfs 
  selinuxfs sfs sockfs sysfs tmpfs ubifs udf usbfs ceph fuse.ceph"
  PRUNENAMES = ".git .hg .svn .bzr .arch-ids {arch} CVS"
  PRUNEPATHS = "/afs /media /mnt /net /sfs /tmp /udev /var/cache/ccache /var/lib/yum/yumdb 
  /var/lib/dnf/yumdb /var/spool/cups /var/spool/squid /var/tmp /var/lib/ceph"
  
  As a regular user, you can't see any files from the locate database that you can't see in the
  filesystem normally. For example, if you can't type ls to view files in the /root directory,
  you can't locate files stored in that directory.

Searching for files by permission is an excellent way to turn up security issues on your
  system or uncover access issues.
