    //position a text in center, and then if you want replace the white characters with the desired beginning text

// the map command is like:    map KEY KEYSTROKES  ie:
map <F2> iAhmad Khatib<CR>123 Eseneler Main Street<CR> AnyTown, IST<CR><ESC>
//so anytime you press f2 this instructions will be executed, (similar to macros)
//you can to bind a functionality to a combination of your desired keys, ie 
//the following command will make saving file quicker by pressing \w 
map <leader>w :w!<CR>
//important note: if you didn't use the leader here (\) the w command will be overwritten
let mapleader=","         // change the default leader character (which is \)
//another note: if you changed the leader character, put it above any specified map in order to work first
vmap something   //means this key mapping is available in visual mode only, nmap  :normal mode ,,,,
by default key mapping are recursive, so if you used a mapped key in another key mapping it get expanded
there as well, in speaking of which, ie vnoremap disables this behavior
