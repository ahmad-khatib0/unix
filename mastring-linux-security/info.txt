A lot of those updates require that the system be rebooted before they can take effect. By default, Ubuntu 
  systems don’t automatically reboot after an update is installed. If you keep it that way, you’ll see a message 
  about it when you log into the system. But if you prefer, you can set Ubuntu to automatically reboot after it 
  automatically updates itself. Here’s how to do it:
1. Go into the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d directory and open the 50unattended-upgrades file , In the vicinity of 
   line 67, you’ll see a line that says:  
   //Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "false";
Uncomment the line by removing the leading slashes, and change false to true, like so:
   Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "true";

To disable automatic updates, just go into the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d directory and open the 20auto-upgrades
  chagne: APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1"; to 0

The main functional difference between yum and dnf is that dnf has a different automatic update mechanism. 
  Instead of installing the yum-cron package, you’ll now install the dnf-automatic package, like so:
  sudo dnf install dnf-automatic
