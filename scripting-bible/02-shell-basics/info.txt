User variables can be any text string of up to 20 letters, digits, or
  underscore characters. User variables are case sensitive,

The shell script stores all variable values as text strings; it's up to the
  individual commands in the shell to determine the data type used for the variable value. 

No space allowed between variable name and its declaration

There are two ways to assign the output of a command to a variable:
                   The backtick character,         The $() format
  for example:        testing=`date`,              testing=$(date)     

Command substitution creates what's called a subshell to run the enclosed command. A subshell is 
  a separate child shell generated from the shell that's running the script. Because of that, any
  variables that you create in the script won't be available to commands running in the subshell.
  Subshells are also created if you run a command from the command prompt using the ./ path, but 
  they aren't created if you just run the command without a path. However, if you use a built-in shell 
  command, that doesn't generate a subshell. Be careful when running scripts from the command prompt!

Output redirection:   like: 
  date > filename.txt       # overwrite
  date >> filename.txt      # append
  

Input redirection
  Input redirection is the opposite of output redirection. Instead of taking the output of a command and 
  redirecting it to a file, input redirection takes the content of a file and redirects it to a command.
  The input redirection symbol is the less-than symbol (<): command < inputfile
  The easy way to remember this is that the command is always listed first in
  the command line, and the redirection symbol “points” to the way the data is flowing
  The less-than symbol indicates that the data is flowing from the input file to the command.

The wc command provides a count of text in the data. By default, it produces three values:
    The number of lines in the text
    The number of words in the text
    The number of bytes in the text

There's another method of input redirection, called inline input redirection. This method allows you 
  to specify the data for input redirection on the command line instead of in a file. This may seem 
  somewhat odd at first, but there are a few applications for this process (such as those shown in
  “Performing Math”).

The inline input redirection symbol is the double less-than symbol (<<). Besides this symbol, you must 
  specify a text marker that delineates the beginning and end of the data used for input. You can use 
  any string value for the text marker, but it must be the same at the beginning of the data and
  the end of the data:           command << marker
When using inline input redirection on the command line, the shell will prompt for data using   
  the secondary prompt, defined in the PS2 environment variable, for example

$ wc << EOF 
> test string 1
> test string 2
> test string 3
> EOF
  3      9       42
The secondary prompt continues to prompt for more data until you enter the
  string value for the text marker. The wc command performs the line, word,
  and byte counts of the data supplied by the inline input redirection.


The standard operators work fine in the expr command, but the problem occurs when using them from 
  a script or the command line. Many of the expr command operators have other meanings in the shell 
  (such as the asterisk). Using them in the expr command produces odd results: 
  $ expr 5 * 2       ->> expr: syntax error

To solve this problem, you need to use the shell escape character (the backslash) to identify any 
  characters that may be misinterpreted by the shell before being passed to the expr command:
  $ expr 5 \* 2     ->> 10

The z shell (zsh) provides full floating-point arithmetic operations. If you require 
  floating-point calculations in your shell scripts, you might consider checking out the z shell

A floating-point solution
  There are several solutions for overcoming the Bash integer limitation. The
  most popular solution uses the built-in Bash calculator, called bc.

The basics of bc
  The Bash calculator is actually a programming language that allows you to enter floating-point 
  expressions at a command line and then interprets the expressions, calculates them, and returns 
  the result. The Bash calculator recognizes the following:
--    Numbers (both integer and floating point)
--    Variables (both simple variables and arrays)
--    Comments (lines starting with a pound sign or the C language /* */ pair)
--    Expressions
--    Programming statements (such as if-then statements)
--    Functions

The floating-point arithmetic is controlled by a built-in variable called
  scale. You must set this value to the desired number of decimal places you
  want in your answers or you won't get what you were looking for:    $ bc -q
  
Using bc in scripts
  variable=$(echo `options; expression` | bc)
The first portion, options , allows you to set variables. If you need to set
  more than one variable, separate them using the semicolon. 

NOTE: Any variables created within the Bash calculator (bc) are valid only within 
  the Bash calculator and can't be used in the shell script.

Every command that runs in the shell uses an exit status to indicate to the shell that it's done 
  processing. The exit status is an integer value between 0 and 255 that's passed by the command to 
  the shell when the command finishes running. You can capture this value and use it in your scripts.

Checking the exit status
  Linux provides the $? special variable that holds the exit status value from the last command 
  that executed. You must view or use the $? variable immediately after the command you want to 
  check. It changes values to the exit status of the last command executed by the shell:
$ date
Mon Jun 01 16:01:30 EDT 2020
$ echo $?
0

The invalid command returns an exit status of 127. There's not much of a standard convention 
  to Linux error exit status codes. However, there are a few guidelines you can use

Another common error you'll encounter occurs if you supply an invalid
  parameter to a command:
$ date %t   # ->>> date: invalid date '%t'
$ echo $?   # ->>> 1


The epoch time specifies the time as an integer value of the number of seconds since midnight, 
  January 1, 1970 (it's an old Unix standard). Thus, to get the epoch time for January 1, 2020:
  $date -d "Jan 1, 2020" +%s    ->>>  1577854800
